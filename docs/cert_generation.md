## What are certs used for?
* Internal communications between platform components
  * Kubectl -> API server
  * API Server -> Etcd
  * Etcd <-> Etcd
  * Calico -> Etcd
* Client authentication against the API server
 
## What certs get generated?
* Self-signed certificate to be used as CA
* One certificate for each node on the cluster
* One certificate for an admin user
* One certificate for the private Docker registry, to use that Docker registry each Docker engine that push/pulls from must also have the CA
